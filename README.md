# Segmentation-Based-Image-Compression
The given project explores a method of image compression using K-Means algorithm for color based segmentation. The algorithm for segmentation is implemented from scratch. The algorithm finds 16 most representative colors from thousands from image. You can set them as per your choice too.

The mentioned approach significantly reduces size of image along with maintaining most representative colors. The image used for the purpose is also provided.
